# ASL Extension

Development Notes:
    -Important run commands:
        calibre-customize -b {path to folder}
        This puts the most recent version of what you're working on to your calibre.

        calibre-debug -g
        This runs calibre in debug mode and allows printing the console. This should almost always be used.
